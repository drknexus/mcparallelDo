Description: mcparallelDo provides a function that wraps 
    mcparallel and mccollect with temporary variables and a task
    handler.  Wrapped in this way the results of an mcparallel call 
    can be returned to the R session when the fork is complete 
    without explicitly issuing a specific mccollect to retrieve the value.
    Outside of top-level tasks, multiple mcparallel jobs can be retrieved with 
    a single call to mcparallelDoCheck.
